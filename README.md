# Challenge 1 

Problem 1: What was the average total time (in minutes) used by a bicycle in the data?

Problem 2: What was the most popular day by trip frequency in this dataset?

Problem 3 (harder): Assuming there are 30 bikes per station, find what date and time the bikes FIRST need to be rebalanced. As in, there are 0 bikes at a terminal for a customer to rent. 

Problem 3 (easier): Assuming there are 30 bikes per station, find what date the bikes FIRST need to be rebalanced. As in, there are 0 bikes at a terminal for a customer to rent. Do this ignoring "Start.Date" and "End.Date" columns.

I completed Problems 1,2,3(harder)

Solution is in the chal1 folder as solution. Code accompanies it.
